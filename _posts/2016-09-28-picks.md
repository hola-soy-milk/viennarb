### 09/28 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-seventy-eighth edition:

##### [Markus][markus]
- [Yes, Virginia, You Can Estimate That][markus-1] - When and How to Estimate Software Projects
- [Why Luck Matters More Than You Might Think][markus-2] - Luck is often a bigger factor than anyone likes to admit.
- [Building fast.com][markus-3] - Fast.com is a simple internet speed test that runs on Netflix' infrastructure.

##### [Max][max]
- [Pairing with Junior Developers][max-1] - Old but still valid guide on pairing with junior devs.
- [Brew Bundle][max-2] - "Bundler" for [Homebrew][homebrew], a neat tool for bootstrapping new machines.
- [rbenv][max-3] - Another Ruby version manager (I just switched from [chruby][chruby] and love it!)
