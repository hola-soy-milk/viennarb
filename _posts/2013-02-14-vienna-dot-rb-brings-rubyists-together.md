### Ruby developers and Rails aficionados meet in Austria's capital

On Thursday, March the 7th,  Rails and Ruby developers will exchange their workspaces to meet fellow engineers to discuss their favorite language. Andreas Tiefenthaler, Anton Bangratz and Floor Drees initiated these 'user group meetups', excited to meet like minded people. The vienna.rb meetups are open to both experienced Ruby developers and people that are new to programming.

The first meetup will take place at the [platogo.com][4] office. Jakob Sommerhuber, Rails developer and co-founder of Platogo: _"We'd love to host the event in the cozy atmosphere of our office (free drinks included)!  We're really looking forward to taking part in some interesting talks and meeting like-minded developers from Vienna."_

The meetup is sponsored by [Mjam.at][3], who'll provide pizzas for the participants. The sponsors and host are encouraged to take part in the event or even take on a lightning talk themselves.

The vienna.rb team is collecting topics for lightning talks from their young community. The topics; the recent security issues in Rails, testing in Ruby and RoR and 'benchmarking Ruby', make for an interesting evening of knowledge exchanging and networking.

Rubyslava, organizing Ruby user group meetups in Bratislava, helped kickstart the Ruby community in Vienna offering their experience and support setting up the first 3 vienna.rb sessions. The next editions are planned for Thursday April the 11th and the 9th of May.
